# Poems Around Galway

## About this project

The aim of this project is to bring the poetry of Galway city to students, city residents, and tourists by offering each visitor an engaging virtual literary tour of the city.

1. This is an educational project that’s aimed to appeal to students and make learning about the literature of the city where they live more interesting. I’ve included appealing images and iconic poems that can be easily found, as well as resources so that students can learn more. 

2. This project is also for residents of Galway city who want to explore their town through poetry. I’ve included links in the footer so that locals can access more works by the featured authors in local bookstores. Visitors to the site can reach out to the site owner directly to get involved/receive newsletters about this project and literary events in the city. 

3. As Galway is known world-wide as a literary city/city of culture, this project is built to appeal to tourists visiting the city. The imagery on the homepage evokes city landmarks (known and lesser known).  There’s also an online shop where visitors to the city can order products with poems about Galway printed on them.

Poems Around Galway is ultimately a website for visitors to learn more about the literary history of Galway city. This site is accessible to users of all ages, using any device type, and is aimed at anyone who loves poetry and wants to learn more. 

 
## UX
 
### User stories

I started working on this project by identifying 5 user stories, which were created to address features of the site that were required to appeal to different types of users. I originally had more complex user stories, which would have required JavaScript to deploy. In this case, I editing the user stories to fit the scope of the first Milestone Project. 

One examples of this are User Story 1. The original feature was an interactive search bar, which populates results while a user types a search query. I even built a search bar and was trying to figure out the JavaScript, but this was taking too much time out of the rest of the project. Instead, I simplified the story to reflect a more basic requirement that a teacher may have: interactive online content such as images and an author bio to go with the poems. 

The other user story I adapted is User Story 5. I wanted to build a newsletter pop-up that appears on the homepage. I searched Bootstrap for examples of how to build this without JavaScript/with their JavaScript. In the end I decided that a short form in the footer would do provide a similar user experience, since it would still be noticeable and appear on every page. 

I’ve included my user stories and I what I built to accompany each story below.

#### User Story 1:

Aoife is a secondary school teacher. Aoife wants an interactive place where her students read and learn more about poetry in Galway city. She thinks the students will respond best to images with the poems, as well as author bios.

#### User Story 2:

Charles is a poet. He wants a way to feel connected with the source material for the poems. He wants images of the places where the poems were written.

#### User Story 3: 

Dominic loves to read poetry for fun, but his eyesight isn’t as good as when he was younger. Dominic wants a way to play audio of the poems so he can listen to them instead. 

#### User Story 4:

Amy is visiting Galway for the first time as a tourist. She wants to know where she can buy books of poetry, so she needs links to local book shops. 

#### User Story 5:

Sarah is interested in reading as a hobby and likes to keep track of different literary sites on poetry. She wants a feature where she can sign up to get newsletters for updates on the site.

## Design/Color-palette/Fonts

The first colour I choose for the design of this site is marroon. This is the city colour for Galway. This is relected in the logo, icons throughout the site, and in the background colour for the quote banners on the Home and Poetry Pages. 


The rest of the colour scheme includes shades of blue. There's dark blue on the Home, Contact, and Shop Page to make the images/forms stand out. 
There's lighter block in the background of the Poetry and About Pages, so that the written content is easier to read against dark text. 
I used a cooler/neutral blue in the header/footer of the site. 

The main reasoning behind this blue theme is because it contrasts well with the red. Also, Galway is built on rivers, canals, and Galway Bay. The blue evokes a city surrounded by water. 

My mentor suggested that I build my design palette on https://coolors.co/

[View the full palette here](https://coolors.co/800000-252d41-8db2b9-dbf3fd-e5e8f0)

The fonts I choose were chosen because they're easy to read. I mainly used Arial and Open Sans to make the site more accessible to users with dyslexia as suggested [in this article](https://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/advice/employers/creating-a-dyslexia-friendly-workplace/dyslexia-friendly-style-guide)

I also chose to use Trocchi in some headings because I was inspired by its use on https://poets.org/ 
## Existing Features

#### Feature- User story 2: 

I created a gallery of images of iconic places in Galway. These images correspond with the poems. I actually asked my friend Charles, who is a poet from Galway what he would most like to see on the site. So I created this gallery navigation of the places that go with the poems (more or less) on the homepage. 

I wanted to evoke dinnseanchas or lore of places in this project to show the connection between where a poem is set and the written word. Plus I think this navigation makes a more visually stunning homepage and works to explain the project.

For example, the image for the poem Galway is of the canal, looking over Il Vicolo restaurant. [This image.](/workspace/milestone-project-1/assets/images/galway-weir.jpg)

The image of the old Rahoon cemetery was taken by me. Though less iconic on a city-wide basis, this is an important place in James Joyce’s personal lore that’s featured in his more famous short story: “The Dead”. [This image.](/workspace/milestone-project-1/assets/images/rahoon.JPG)

‘On Nimmo’s Pier’ features the well-known red-sailed Galway hookers docked in the pier. I used this image because these boats are docked in the pier during the summer. So the boats are strongly connected to this area of the city. [This image.](/workspace/milestone-project-1/assets/images/galway-hookers.jpg)

For ‘Men with Tired Hair’ I couldn’t get a good image of Prospect Hill, since it is largely a commercial area of the city. I considered taking a picture of my doctor’s office that’s located in this area of the town. 
However, any picture I tried to take of the hill looked awkward and a bit less vibrant than some of areas of the city with more colourful shopfronts and pubs. So I used an image of Eyre Square and it’s flags of the 12 tribes. 
Eyre Square is located at the bottom of the hill, so sitting out on Prospect Hill, one would look out over this square. [This image.](/workspace/milestone-project-1/assets/images/eyre-square.jpg)

Finally, I added an overlay that appears when you hover over the images, so that a user knows to click on the image to go directly to the Poems page. 


#### Feature- User story 3: 

I added audio elements to the poem page, placing each element directly below each poem. 

To get the audio files, I used an external microphone. My husband and I read the poems out loud and recorded our readings. 

Then, I added the audio files to the audio elements.

#### Feature- User story 4: 

I added footer links to three bookshops in Galway: Charlie Byrnes, Easons, and Kenny’s. The links can be used by anyone: local resident or tourist to buy books online/locate these bookshops in the city. 

There were a few reasons why I wanted to add a tourism element to this site. One reason is because I came to this city I now live in for the first time as a student and a tourist, so I understand how this city draws in people with writing, musical, artistic, or other creative backgrounds. 

Tourism is also a major industry. As this is a project built around a specific community, it makes sense to point traffic from tourists that visit this site looking to learn more about local literature to local businesses. 

#### Feature- User story 5:

I added a newsletter sign up form to the footer of the site. As a broader goal, I would use this form to stay in touch with writers in the city to notify them of literary events happening in town.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
